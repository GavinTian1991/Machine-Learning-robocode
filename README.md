# Machine-Learning-Robocode
This is the UBC CPEN502 'Architectures For Learning Systems' course project. The course link is: https://courses.ece.ubc.ca/592/EECE592_WebSite_2009/Welcome.html  
This course is about machine learning with emphasis on artificial Neural Networks  

Environments:  
Coding in 'Eclipse' with Java  
Install 'Robocode' (Robocode is an IBMâ€™s Java Learning tool which needs to build personal tank against the others: https://robocode.sourceforge.io/)  

Project1: Implement a multi-layer perceptron and train it using the Error-Backpropagation algorithm. Set up a 2-input, 4-hidden and 1-output Neural Networks  
Project2: Implement Reinforcement Learning for your robot tank in 'Robocode' environment, using a Look-Up-Table (LUT) to update robot's battle strategy  
Project3: Implement Reinforcement Learning with Backpropagation for your robot tank in 'Robocode' environment, using a Neural Networks to update robot's battle strategy
